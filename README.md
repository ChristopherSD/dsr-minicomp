# Mini competition at Data Science Retreat Batch 23

This repo represents the submission for the mini competition at [Data Science Retreat](#https://www.datascienceretreat.com/)
during Batch 23. The team consists of Michael Drews, Tomasz IÅ¼ycki, and Christopher Dick (the owner of this repo). The 
task is to predict the sales of a given store and date. The datasets are based on the kaggle competition 
"[Rossmann Store Sales](#https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales)". For more information on the competition, 
have a look at the original repo [here](#https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/minicomp-rossman).
